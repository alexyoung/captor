h2. About Captor

Captor uses Shoes to create a GUI for Capistrano Capfiles.

* This is a prototype proof of concept
* I'm currently using drb to access Capfiles because Shoes is having trouble with net/ssh

h2. Usage

Make sure you run <code>cap_serve.rb</code>.  This won't be needed in the future, it's just until I can get Shoes running with Capistrano.

Define a list of projects in captor.rb (obviously this will work through the user interface in the future.)

<code>
ruby cap_serve.rb
open captor.rb -a /Applications/Shoes.app
</code>
